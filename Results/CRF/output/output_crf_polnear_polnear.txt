Last	O

I	B-SOURCE
asked	B-CUE
both	O
the	O
Trump	O

campaigns	B-CUE
to	I-CUE
explain	I-CUE
how	B-CONTENT

Mr.	B-SOURCE

nothing	B-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT

a	I-CONTENT

that	B-CONTENT
in	I-CONTENT
last	I-CONTENT
Sunday	I-CONTENT

's	I-CONTENT

,	O
Mr.	B-SOURCE

would	I-CONTENT
end	I-CONTENT

the	I-CONTENT

he	I-CONTENT

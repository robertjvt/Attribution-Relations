To	O
conclude	O
that	O

Q.	O
I	O
'm	O
writing	O

you	O

tell	O
me	O
what	O
might	O

happened	O
to	O
my	O
11	O
year	O

daughter	O
when	O
she	O
received	O
her	O
second	O
Hepatitis	O

After	O
the	O

injected	O
the	O

into	O
her	O

she	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
almost	O

into	O
the	O

fell	O
flat	O

I	O
went	O

pick	O
her	O
up	O
not	O

what	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
lifted	O
her	O
up	O
she	O
was	O
lifeless	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
her	O
body	O
started	O

shake	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
frightening	O

The	O
nurse	O
and	O
doctor	O
came	O
over	O
to	O
her	O
and	O
she	O
started	O

She	B-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
passed	I-CONTENT

,	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
when	I-CONTENT
she	I-CONTENT
hit	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

her	I-CONTENT

bleeding	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
she	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
get	I-CONTENT
six	I-CONTENT
stitches	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	O
doctor	O
seems	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
she	O
just	O
passed	O
out	O
,	O
but	O
I	B-SOURCE
am	B-CUE
concerned	I-CUE

why	B-CONTENT
she	I-CONTENT

the	I-CONTENT

!	I-CONTENT

She	O

,	O

I	O

I	O

What	O

and	O
you	O
will	O

it	O

a	O

one	O
that	O

If	O
you	O
do	O

about	O
the	O

get	O

the	O

They	O
are	O
only	O
little	O

do	O

at	O
all	O

The	O
thought	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
worse	O
than	O
the	O

Maybe	O
do	O
a	O

of	O
google	O

where	O
there	O
are	O
any	O

I	O

the	O

why	O
not	O
take	O

especially	O
away	O
from	O

if	O
you	O

you	O

n't	O
get	O
it	O

Feeling	O
lucky	O
?	O

By	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
supposed	O
to	O
berate	O
you	O
for	O
seeking	O
medical	O
advice	O
on	O
the	O

but	O
since	O
you	O
already	O
talked	O
to	O
your	O

you	O
're	O
OK	O

Now	O
you	O
'll	O

a	O

Frankly	O
,	O
I	O
'd	O
be	O
changing	O
physicians	O

The	O
CDC	O
is	O
very	O
conservative	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
pretty	O
much	O
every	O
physician	O
I	O
know	O
goes	O
by	O
their	O
recommendations	O

And	O
,	O
I	O
used	O

be	O
a	O

I	O
just	O

We	O
took	O

for	O

,	O
did	O
n't	O
take	O
them	O
for	O
Belize	O

endemic	O

I	O
simply	O
ca	O
n't	O
fathom	O
a	O

it	O

Sounds	O
like	O
a	O
smart	O
doctor	O
since	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
drugs	O
can	O
have	O
much	O
worse	O
side	O

than	O
the	O

maybe	O
they	O
'd	O
been	O

It	O
's	O
extremely	O
rare	O
here	O

it	O

the	O

it	O

Malaria	O
The	O

from	O
more	O

1000	O

.	O

It	O
basically	O
depends	O
where	O
you	B-SOURCE
intend	B-CUE
to	B-CONTENT
travel	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
your	I-CONTENT
level	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT

San	O

lower	O
risk	O
than	O
small	O
remote	O
villages	O
in	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
ways	O
you	O
can	O
reduce	O
the	O
risk	O
:	O
sleeping	O
in	O
screened	O
rooms	O
,	O
covering	O
up	O
during	O
peak	O

,	O
wearing	O

and	O
removing	O
any	O

water	O
which	O
provides	O
a	O
breeding	O
ground	O
for	O

.	O

The	O
other	O
disease	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
aware	O
of	O
is	O
dengue	O

It	O
is	O

by	O
some	O
species	O
of	O
mosquito	O
,	O
and	O
since	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
prophylactic	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
important	O
that	O
prevention	O
is	O
sought	O
by	O
reducing	O
the	O
habitat	O
and	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
mosquitoes	O
and	O
limiting	O
exposure	O
to	O

.	O

The	O
number	O
of	O
dengue	O
cases	O
has	O
varied	O
greatly	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
because	O
dengue	O
cases	O
tend	O
to	O

from	O

In	O
most	O

,	O
the	O
number	O

50	O

in	O
2005	O
,	O
2009	O
&	O
2010	O

Orange	O

this	O
is	O
a	O
disease	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
just	O
occur	O
in	O
smaller	O

what	O

the	O
final	O
verdict	O
?	O

I	O
am	O
travelling	O
from	O

The	O
final	O
verdict	O
should	O
be	O
between	O
you	O
and	O
a	O
physician	O
who	O
knows	O
something	O
about	O
travel	O
medicine	O
.	O

After	O
speaking	O
with	O
someone	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
up	O
to	O
you	O

on	O
the	O
level	O
of	O

that	O
you	O
're	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
trade	O
off	O

the	O
anti-malarials	O

have	O
side	O

neither	O
Cholorquine	O
or	O
Malarone	O

me	O

I	O
personally	O
think	O
everyone	O
should	O
be	O
vaccinated	O
against	O
Hepatitis	O
A	O
&	O
B.	O
Both	O
diseases	O
are	O
out	O
there	O

Hepatitis	O
A	O
happen	O

the	O

Several	O
people	O
died	O
from	O
it	O
in	O
Pittsburgh	O
not	O
too	O
many	O
years	O
ago	O

Everyone	O
should	O
also	O
keep	O
their	O
tetanus	O
up	O
to	O
date	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
now	O
,	O
there	O
's	O
an	O
adult	O
form	O
that	O
also	O
prevents	O
pertussis	O
(	O
whooping	O

)	O

Pertussis	O
is	O
n't	O
a	O
serious	O
disease	O
for	O
healthy	O

coughing	O
for	O
up	O

is	O
n't	O
fun	O
)	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
kills	O

,	O
if	O
you	O

My	O
6	O
year	O
old	O
boxer	O
had	O
her	O
puppy	O
shots	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
the	O
series	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
reaction	O
where	O
her	O
face	O
swelled	O
up	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
to	O
the	O
emergency	O
room	O
.	O

Fast	O
forward	O
to	O
her	O
1	O
year	O
shots	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
super	O
nervous	O
about	O
giving	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
vet	O
would	O
not	O
work	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
or	O
write	O
me	O
an	O
exemption	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
past	O
5	O
years	O
,	O
I	O
switch	O
vets	O
every	O
time	O
they	O
pressure	O
me	O
too	O
hard	O
to	O
vaccinate	O
my	O
dog	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
in	O
last	O
week	O
and	O
allowed	O
her	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
rabies	O
vaccine	O
.	O

I	B-SOURCE
warned	B-CUE
of	O
the	O
terrible	O
reactions	O
she	O
has	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
“	O
pre-treated	O
”	O
her	O
.	O

While	O
she	B-SOURCE
didnt	O
get	O
the	O
facial	O
swelling	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
notice	O
a	O
lump	O
about	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
an	O
egg	O
where	O
the	O
shot	O
was	O
given	O
.	O

I	O
called	O
the	O
vet	O
and	O
she	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
dog	O
back	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
vet	O
determined	O
it	O
was	O
swelling	O
(	O
not	O
fluid	O
)	O
heart	O
rate	O
and	O
blood	O
pressure	O
was	O
fine	O
.	O

Now	O
it	O
5	O
days	O
later	O
and	O
that	O
lump	O
is	O
still	O
there	O

Ive	O
googled	O
the	O
hell	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
not	O

do	O
not	O

Immunization	O
works	O
by	O
tricking	O
the	O
body	O
into	O
believing	O
it	O
is	O
experiencing	O
a	O
full-scale	O
invasion	O
by	O
an	O
infectious	O
agent	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
immune	O
system	O
can	O
fortify	O
its	O
defenses	O
.	O

During	O
vaccination	O
,	O
a	O
harmless	O
version	O
of	O
a	O
germ	O
is	O
introduced	O
to	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
the	O
immune	O
system	O
responds	O
by	O
producing	O
antibodies	O
to	O
attack	O
the	O
intruder	O
.	O

Thereafter	O
,	O
a	O
memory	O
of	O
this	O
invasion	O
remains	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
immune	O
system	O
can	O
quickly	O
recognize	O
and	O
neutralize	O
disease-causing	O
agents	O
when	O
they	O
appear	O
.	O

The	O
Chinese	O
performed	O
a	O
version	O
of	O
vaccination	O
called	O
variolation	O
in	O
the	O
16th	O
century	O
when	O
they	B-SOURCE
discovered	B-CUE
they	B-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
prevent	I-CONTENT
smallpox	I-CONTENT
by	I-CONTENT
exposing	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
healthy	I-CONTENT
person	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
matter	I-CONTENT
from	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
lesions	I-CONTENT

In	O
1796	O
,	O
Edward	O
Jenner	O
,	O
an	O
English	O
doctor	O
,	O
performed	O
the	O
first	O
vaccination	O
in	O
Europe	O
when	O
he	O
used	O
a	O
cowpox	O
virus	O
to	O
vaccinate	O
a	O
young	O
boy	O
against	O
the	O
more	O
deadly	O
smallpox	O
virus	O

Today	O
there	O
are	O
several	O
types	O
of	O
vaccines	O
.	O

Some	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
oral	O
polio	O
vaccine	O
(	O
OPV	O
)	O
,	O
are	O
live	O
,	O
attenuated	O
vaccines	O
which	O
means	O
the	O
virus	O
has	O
been	O
weakened	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
stimulates	O
antibody	O
production	O
,	O
but	O
does	O
not	O
cause	O
the	O
disease	O
.	O

Others	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
whole-cell	O
pertussis	O
vaccine	O
use	O
an	O
inactivated	O
,	O
or	O
killed	O
,	O
virus	O
that	O
still	O
triggers	O
an	O
immune	O
response	O
.	O

Tetanus	O
toxoid	O
(	O
TT	O
)	O
,	O
the	O
vaccine	O
that	O
protects	O
mothers	O
and	O
newborns	O
from	O
tetanus	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
detoxified	O
version	O
of	O
the	O
toxin	O
(	O
poison	O
)	O
that	O
causes	O
the	O
disease	O
.	O

A	O
fourth	O
variety	O
of	O
vaccine	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
that	O
for	O
Haemophilus	O
influenzae	O
type	O
b	O
(	O
Hib	O
)	O
,	O
uses	O
only	O
the	O
components	O
of	O
the	O
virus	O
or	O
bacteria	O
that	O
provoke	O
an	O
immune	O
response	O
.	O

Mothers	O
can	O
pass	O
on	O
immunity	O
to	O
their	O
babies	O
across	O
the	O
placenta	O
during	O
the	O
final	O
months	O
of	O
pregnancy	O
.	O

The	O
amount	O
of	O
inherited	O
immunity	O
varies	O
by	O
disease	O
and	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
factor	O
in	O
deciding	O
when	O
a	O
child	O
should	O
be	O
immunized	O
.	O

A	O
mother	O
's	O
antibodies	O
may	O
protect	O
a	O
child	O
from	O
measles	O
for	O
6	O
to	O
12	O
months	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
diseases	O
such	O
as	O
pertussis	O
,	O
immunity	O
may	O
last	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
.	O

Tetanus	O
is	O
one	O
example	O
where	O
inherited	O
immunity	O
is	O
critical	O
and	O
the	O
mother	O
must	O
be	O
immunized	O
to	O
offer	O
protection	O
to	O
her	O
newborn	O
.	O

For	O
many	O
diseases	O
,	O
immunity	O
is	O
built	O
up	O
over	O
several	O
doses	O
of	O
vaccine	O
.	O

The	B-SOURCE

along	O

the	O

In	O
countries	O
where	O
transmission	O
of	O
hepatitis	O
B	O
from	O
mother	O
to	O
child	O
is	O
common	O
,	O
these	O
infants	O
should	O
be	O

against	O
the	O
disease	O
at	O

The	O

and	O
the	O
combination	O
diphtheria	O

at	O
six	O
weeks	O

14	O

Due	O
to	O
inherited	O
immunity	O
,	O
measles	O
vaccines	O
are	O
typically	O
given	O
at	O
nine	O
months	O

is	O
also	O
given	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
for	O
children	O
in	O

The	O
more	O
children	O
in	O
a	O

that	O
are	O
vaccinated	O
,	O
the	O
less	O
likely	O
it	O

that	O
any	O
children	O
,	O
even	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
immunized	O
,	O
will	O
get	O
sick	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
fewer	O

for	O
the	O

agents	O

This	O
is	O
referred	O
to	O
as	O

immunity	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
particularly	O
vital	O
with	O
extremely	O
contagious	O
diseases	O
such	O
as	O

where	O
immunization	O
of	O
90	O

Aluminum	O

are	O

because	O

Our	O
perspective	O
:	O
Like	O
any	O
other	O
medical	O
treatment	O
,	O
vaccination	O
must	O
be	O
justified	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
an	O
objective	O
risk/benefit	O
analysis	O
.	O

All	O
risks	O
and	O
benefits	O
must	O
be	O
considered	O
.	O

Any	O
rational	O
medical	O
treatment	O
must	O
do	O
more	O
good	O
than	O
harm	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
universally	O
accepted	O
.	O

The	O
problem	O
with	O
vaccines	O
is	O
that	O
risks	O
have	O
been	O
underestimated	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
benefits	O
overestimated	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
brain	O
injury	O
from	O
vaccines	O
is	O
much	O
higher	O
than	O
commonly	O
believed	O
.	O

Brain	O
injury	O
can	O
be	O
devastating	O
to	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
a	O
child	O

the	O

.	O

The	O
personal	O
and	O
financial	O
costs	O
of	O
vaccine	O
injury	O
are	O
often	O
enormous	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
even	O
a	O
small	O
risk	O
of	O
brain	O
injury	O
must	O
be	O
considered	O
seriously	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
science	O
strongly	O
suggests	O
that	O
the	O
risk	O
is	O
not	O
small	O
.	O

Vaccinepapers.org	O
is	O
not	O
ideologically	O

may	O
be	O
worth	O
the	O

for	O
some	O
people	O
in	O
some	O
situations	O

The	O
risk	O
of	O
a	O

How	O
measles	O
can	O
change	O
a	O
life	O
In	O
the	O
early	O
1990s	O
we	O
lived	O
in	O
Berlin	O
,	O
Germany	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
young	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
plans	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
.	O

My	O
wife	O
Anke	O
was	O
working	O
as	O
a	O
nurse	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
started	O
my	O
professional	O
career	O
as	O
an	O
engineer	O
.	O

We	O
became	O
a	O
little	O
family	O
when	O
Julian	O
,	O
our	O
older	O
son	O
,	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
of	O
1992	O
.	O

We	O
built	O
our	O
“	O
nest	I-CONTENT
”	I-CONTENT
,	O
had	O
great	O
friends	O
and	O
neighbours	O
,	O
and	O
simply	O
enjoyed	O
life	O
as	O
a	O
young	O
family	O
.	O

As	O
most	O
parents	O
probably	O
are	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
grateful	O
and	O
thankful	O
.	O

Two	O
years	O
later	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
summer	O
of	O
1994	O
,	O
our	O
second	O
child	O
,	O
Maximilian	O
,	O
saw	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
day	O
and	O
made	O
our	O
family	O
happiness	O
complete	O
.	O

Back	O
then	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
slightest	O
idea	O
of	O
how	O
dramatically	O
our	O
lives	O
would	O
change	O
some	O
years	O
later	O
.	O

Max	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
blessing	O
and	O
a	O
challenge	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
energy	O
and	O
life	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
sometimes	O
hard	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
under	O
control	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
charming	O
,	O
even	O
as	O
a	O
baby	O
.	O

He	O
won	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
around	O
him	O
in	O
no	O
time	O
.	O

Max	O
in	O
2005	O
When	O
he	O
got	O
sick	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
of	O
1994/1995	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
bit	O
worried	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
young	O
age	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
six	O
months	O
old	O
when	O
measles	O
hit	O
him	O
badly	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
way	O
too	O
early	O
for	O
vaccination	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
too	O
early	O
for	O
infection	O
.	O

He	O
spent	O
several	O
days	O
with	O
a	O
high	O
fever	O
while	O
his	B-SOURCE
paediatrician	I-SOURCE
feared	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
he	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
develop	I-CONTENT
some	I-CONTENT
sort	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
complications	I-CONTENT
.	O

And	O
he	O
did	O
:	O
his	O
lungs	O
got	O
affected	O
,	O
he	O
developed	O
a	O
dry	O
cough	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
he	O
even	O
had	O
difficulties	O
breathing	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
concerned	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
no	O
clue	O
and	O
nobody	O
had	O
ever	O
mentioned	O
anything	O
about	O
potentially	O
fatal	O
measles	O
complications	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
everything	O
was	O
over	O
.	O

Max	O
had	O
recovered	O
and	O
as	O
spring	O
came	O
around	O
,	O
the	O
vivid	O
,	O
high-energy	O
boy	O
was	O
back	O
.	O

What	B-CONTENT
we	I-CONTENT
did	I-CONTENT
not	I-CONTENT
know	I-CONTENT
back	I-CONTENT
then	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
he	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
only	I-CONTENT
stay	I-CONTENT
with	I-CONTENT
us	I-CONTENT
for	I-CONTENT
another	I-CONTENT
10	I-CONTENT
years	I-CONTENT
.	O

When	O
Max	O
was	O
in	O
third	O
grade	O
of	O
elementary	O
school	O
his	O
performance	O
in	O
math	O
suddenly	O
dropped	O
.	O

Initially	O
we	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
his	O
high	O
energy	O
level	O
and	O
his	O
difficulty	O
concentrating	O
sometimes	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
he	O
started	O
showing	O
some	O
strange	O
behaviours	O
–	O
only	O
for	O
short	O
moments	O
,	O
but	O
becoming	O
more	O
frequent	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
realise	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
signs	O
…	O
In	O
October	O
of	O
2004	O
the	O
first	O
seizure	O
occurred	O
.	O

Max	O
would	O
stop	O
doing	O
anything	O
–	O
from	O
one	O
second	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
–	O
he	O
would	O
sit	O
and	O
stare	O
.	O

Just	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
seconds	O
or	O
sometimes	O
a	O
minute	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
seizure	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
remember	O
anything	O
.	O

We	O
learned	O
that	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
seizure	O
is	O
called	O
‘	O
absence	O
’	O
.	O

The	B-SOURCE
doctors	I-SOURCE
told	B-CUE
us	O
that	O
sometimes	O
children	O
would	O
develop	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
epilepsy	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
just	O
about	O
to	O
enter	O
puberty	O
.	O

So	O
we	B-SOURCE
thought	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
maybe	I-CONTENT
it	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT
temporary	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
eventually	I-CONTENT
go	I-CONTENT
away	I-CONTENT
.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
bad	O
sign	O
:	O
Max	O
’s	O
EEG	O
that	O
was	O
taken	O
shortly	O
after	O
his	O
first	O
seizure	O
was	O
entirely	O
abnormal	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
curve	O
patterns	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
belong	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
doctors	O
tried	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
seizures	O
by	O
a	O
special	O
mix	O
of	O
anticonvulsants	O
.	O

And	O
actually	O
it	O
did	O
help	O
–	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
.	O

Between	O
December	O
of	O
2004	O
and	O
February	O
of	O
2005	O
our	O
beloved	O
boy	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
.	O

We	O
thought	O
that	O
finally	O
we	O
had	O

Stratified	O

the	O

We	O

sadly	O

I	O
fear	O

have	O
already	O
decided	O
that	O

for	O

Tragically	O
,	O
many	O

seem	O
to	O
be	O
painfully	O
ignorant	O
about	O
the	O

I	O
'm	O
always	O

that	O

If	O

The	O
most	O

that	O

Some	B-SOURCE

If	O

This	O

on	O
the	O
notion	O
that	O

the	O

when	O

well	O
on	O

I	O
was	O

when	O

came	O

I	O
noticed	O
that	O
her	O

were	O
not	O

she	O
could	O

anything	O

“	O

The	O
measles	O
had	O
turned	O
into	O
a	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O

That	O
was	O
twenty-four	O

even	O
now	O

I	O
was	O

for	O

That	O
is	O
about	O

I	O
should	O

there	O
would	O

of	O
your	O

So	O
what	O
on	O

are	O
you	O
worrying	O
about	O
?	O

It	O
really	O
is	O
almost	O
a	O
crime	O
to	O
allow	O
your	O

to	O
go	O
unimmunised	O

The	O
ideal	O
time	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
done	O
is	O
at	O
13	O
months	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
never	O
too	O
late	O
.	O

All	O
school-children	O
who	O
have	O
not	O
yet	O
had	O

should	O
beg	O

those	O

changing	O
now	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
chickenpox	O
vaccine	O
.	O

The	O
chickenpox	O
vaccine	O
is	O
a	O
shot	O
that	O
can	O
protect	O
nearly	O
anyone	O
who	O
receives	O
the	O
vaccine	O
from	O
catching	O
chickenpox	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
also	O
called	O
the	O
varicella	O
vaccine	O
,	O
because	O
chickenpox	O
is	O
caused	O
by	O
the	O
varicella-zoster	O
virus	O
.	O

The	O
vaccine	O
is	O
made	O
from	O
a	O
live	O
but	O
weakened	O
,	O
or	O
attenuated	O
,	O
virus	O

Viruses	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
attenuated	O
are	O
less	O
virulent	O
than	O
viruses	O
that	O
are	O
not	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
virus	O
in	O
the	O
chickenpox	O
vaccine	O
is	O
generally	O
incapable	O
of	O
causing	O
a	O
disease	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
stimulates	O
a	O
response	O
from	O
the	O
body	O
's	O
immune	O
system	O

That	O
response	O
is	O
what	O
gives	O
someone	O
who	O
's	O
had	O
a	O
shot	O
for	O
chickenpox	O
immunity	O
or	O
protection	O
from	O
the	O

Most	O
cases	O
of	O
chickenpox	O
are	O
relatively	O
mild	O
and	O
run	O
their	O
course	O
in	O
five	O
to	O
10	O
days	O

But	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
serious	O
,	O
even	O
life-threatening	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
percentage	O
of	O
people	O

Before	O
the	O
varicella	O
vaccine	O
was	O
licensed	O
in	O
the	O
U.S.	O
in	O
1995	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
approximately	O
100	O
deaths	O
and	O
more	O
than	O
11,000	O
hospitalizations	O
a	O
year	O
from	O
chickenpox	O
.	O

The	O
risk	O
of	O
serious	O
,	O
life-threatening	O
complications	O
is	O
greatest	O
among	O
infants	O
,	O
adults	O

and	O
people	O
with	O

But	O
anyone	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
predict	O
who	O

There	O
's	O
another	O
reason	O
for	O
getting	O
a	O
shot	O
for	O
chickenpox	O
.	O

The	O
illness	O
is	O
highly	O
contagious	O
and	O
can	O
be	O
spread	O
by	O
direct	O
contact	O
or	O
through	O
the	O
air	O
by	O
sneezing	O
or	O
coughing	O

Also	O
,	O
someone	O
can	O
get	O
it	O
by	O
coming	O
in	O
contact	O
with	O
fluid	O
from	O
chickenpox	O
blisters	O
.	O

For	O
that	O
reason	O
,	O
children	O
with	O
chickenpox	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
school	O
or	O
day	O
care	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
more	O
until	O
all	O
blisters	O
have	O
dried	O

crusted	O
over	O

The	O
illness	O
causes	O
an	O

that	O
usually	O
forms	O
between	O
200	O

blisters	O
over	O
the	O
entire	O
body	O
,	O
headaches	O
,	O
coughing	O
,	O
and	O
fussiness	O
.	O

So	O
even	O
if	O
the	O
illness	O
is	O
mild	O
,	O
it	O
still	O
means	O
five	O
to	O
10	O
days	O

Most	O

that	O

actually	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O

Greg	B-SOURCE

at	O
the	O
CDC	O
,	O
two	O

are	O
97	O
percent	O
effective	O
against	O

.	O

(	O
Compare	O
that	O
to	O
88	O
percent	O
for	O
two	O

of	O
the	O

from	O

It	O
’s	O
a	O
live	O
version	O
of	O
the	O
virus	O
,	O
just	O
weakened	O
—	O
or	O
attenuated	O
—	O
so	O
it	O
does	O
n’t	O
cause	O
severe	O
symptoms	O
.	O

The	O
vaccine	O
replicates	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
full-on	O
measles	O
virus	O
,	O
inciting	O
your	O
immune	O
system	O
to	O
produce	O
antibodies	O
against	O
it	O
.	O

Those	O
antibodies	O
then	O
protect	O
against	O
actual	O
measles	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
some	O
people	O
,	O
that	O
response	O
just	O
does	O
n’t	O
happen	O
.	O

No	O
one	O
knows	O
why	O
.	O

Either	O
your	O
body	O
does	O
n’t	O
produce	O
enough	O
antibodies	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
ones	O
it	O
does	O
produce	O
are	O
n’t	O
specific	O
enough	O
to	O
latch	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
virus	O
and	O
kill	O
it	O
.	O

That	O
’s	O
why	O
the	B-SOURCE
CDC	I-SOURCE
recommends	B-CUE
two	B-CONTENT
doses	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
vaccine	I-CONTENT
:	O
After	O
the	O
first	O
dose	O
,	O
5	O

7	O
percent	O

wo	O
n’t	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
enough	O
antibody	O
response	O
to	O
protect	O
them	O
.	O

A	O
second	O
dose	O
ensures	O
that	O
enough	O
people	O
get	O
antibodies	O
above	O
that	O
protective	O
threshold	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
disease	O
.	O

“	B-CONTENT

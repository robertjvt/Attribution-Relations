the	O

It	O
is	O

more	I-CONTENT

yet	O
because	O

Babies	O

some	O

some	O

this	O
residual	O

So	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
approach	O
for	O

is	O
to	O
try	O

MMR	O

the	O

Dr.	B-SOURCE

out	I-CUE
that	B-CONTENT

do	I-CONTENT

He	B-SOURCE
went	B-CUE
on	I-CUE

why	B-CONTENT

The	O
current	O
vaccines	O
contain	O
a	O
few	O
antigens	O
,	O
which	O
create	O
“	O

whereby	O
the	O
immune	O

to	O
the	O
vaccine	O
is	O
abnormal	O

That	O
first-learned	O
response	O

in	O

This	O

Gastroenteritis	O
is	O
a	O

that	O
everyone	O

from	O

However	O
,	O
in	O

I	B-SOURCE
also	O
learned	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
there	I-CONTENT
are	I-CONTENT
preventative	I-CONTENT
measures	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
I	I-CONTENT
can	I-CONTENT
take	I-CONTENT

I	O
had	O
no	O
idea	O
what	O

was	O
to	O

for	O
a	O

of	O

and	O
that	O
everyone	O
will	O
contract	O
this	O

in	O

This	O
relates	O
to	O
my	O
life	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
when	O
somebody	O
including	O
myself	O
have	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
“	O
the	O

”	O
we	O
just	O
take	O
pepto	O
bismol	O
and	O
expect	O
the	O

to	O
go	O
away	O
when	O
in	O
reality	O
the	O
norovirus	O
causing	O

is	O
to	O

The	O
adjustment	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
make	O
from	O
the	O
gaining	O
of	O
this	O

is	O
to	O

the	O

of	O
this	O

with	O
its	O

This	O

would	O
be	O

that	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
hospitalized	O
for	O
the	O
norovirus	O

This	O
can	O
relate	O
to	O
something	O
in	O

because	O
i	O
have	O
food	O

i	B-SOURCE

that	B-CONTENT
this	I-CONTENT

the	B-SOURCE

I	B-SOURCE

it	O

I	B-SOURCE

Because	O
there	O

the	O

If	O

I	B-SOURCE

a	O

I	O

at	O

I	B-SOURCE

it	B-CONTENT

to	I-CONTENT
create	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT

I	B-SOURCE

this	B-CONTENT
will	I-CONTENT
prevent	I-CONTENT

If	O

with	O

the	O

on	O
the	O

an	I-CONTENT

That	O
might	O

I	B-SOURCE

it	O

that	O

is	O
true	O

I	B-SOURCE

it	B-CONTENT

more	I-CONTENT

not	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
even	I-CONTENT
worry	I-CONTENT
about	I-CONTENT

instead	O
ask	B-CUE

to	B-CONTENT
look	I-CONTENT

the	I-CONTENT

decide	O
whether	O
it	O

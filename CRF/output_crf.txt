Q.	O
Hello	O

I	O
am	O
writing	O
because	O
I	O
am	B-CUE
quite	I-CUE
concerned	I-CUE
about	I-CUE
my	B-CONTENT
18	I-CONTENT

old	I-CONTENT
sister	I-CONTENT
who	I-CONTENT
has	I-CONTENT
been	I-CONTENT
getting	I-CONTENT
grand	I-CONTENT
mal	I-CONTENT
seizures	I-CONTENT
for	I-CONTENT
three	I-CONTENT
years	I-CONTENT
now	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
ever	I-CONTENT
since	I-CONTENT
she	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
vaccinated	I-CONTENT
against	I-CONTENT
Hepatitis	I-CONTENT
b	I-CONTENT
.	O

She	B-CONTENT
got	I-CONTENT
her	I-CONTENT
first	I-CONTENT
seizure	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
day	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

taking	I-CONTENT

However	O
,	O
she	B-SOURCE
has	B-CUE

even	I-CONTENT
more	I-CONTENT
annoying	I-CONTENT
symptoms	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
one	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
them	I-CONTENT
being	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
she	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
constantly	I-CONTENT
seeing	I-CONTENT
flashing	I-CONTENT
lights	I-CONTENT

dark	I-CONTENT
spots	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
which	I-CONTENT
make	I-CONTENT
it	I-CONTENT
very	I-CONTENT
difficult	I-CONTENT

her	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
read	I-CONTENT

concentrate	I-CONTENT
on	I-CONTENT
other	I-CONTENT
things	I-CONTENT

The	B-SOURCE
doctor	I-SOURCE
she	I-SOURCE
just	B-CUE
saw	I-CUE
said	I-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
seizures	I-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT
atrophying	I-CONTENT
her	I-CONTENT
occipital	I-CONTENT
lobe	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
seizure	I-CONTENT
activity	I-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
even	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT
spreading	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
temporal	I-CONTENT
lobe	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
which	I-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
start	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
affect	I-CONTENT
her	I-CONTENT
intelligence	I-CONTENT

He	B-SOURCE
also	B-CUE
said	I-CUE
that	B-CONTENT

saw	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
not	I-CONTENT
too	I-CONTENT

he	I-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
not	I-CONTENT
tell	I-CONTENT
whether	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
small	I-CONTENT
size	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
occipital	I-CONTENT

was	I-CONTENT
caused	I-CONTENT
by	I-CONTENT
atrophy	I-CONTENT
or	I-CONTENT
fluid	I-CONTENT
in	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

I	I-CONTENT
'm	I-CONTENT

why	O
not	O

lucky	O
?	O

By	O
the	O

we	O

you	O

I	O

The	O

pretty	O

every	O

I	O

Malaria	I-CONTENT
The	I-CONTENT
number	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
cases	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
malaria	I-CONTENT
in	I-CONTENT
Belize	I-CONTENT
has	I-CONTENT
fallen	I-CONTENT
significantly	I-CONTENT
over	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
past	I-CONTENT
several	I-CONTENT
years	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
from	I-CONTENT
more	I-CONTENT
than	I-CONTENT
1000	I-CONTENT
cases	I-CONTENT
per	I-CONTENT
year	I-CONTENT
prior	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
2006	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
less	I-CONTENT

100	I-CONTENT

were	I-CONTENT
in	I-CONTENT
Stann	I-CONTENT
Creek	I-CONTENT
District	I-CONTENT
)	I-CONTENT
.	O

It	I-CONTENT
basically	I-CONTENT
depends	I-CONTENT
where	I-CONTENT
you	I-CONTENT
intend	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
travel	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
your	I-CONTENT
level	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
risk	I-CONTENT
.	O

San	B-CONTENT
Pedro	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT
lower	I-CONTENT

small	I-CONTENT
remote	I-CONTENT
villages	I-CONTENT
in	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
south	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
country	I-CONTENT
.	O

Some	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
ways	I-CONTENT
you	I-CONTENT
can	I-CONTENT
reduce	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
risk	I-CONTENT
:	I-CONTENT
sleeping	I-CONTENT
in	I-CONTENT
screened	I-CONTENT
rooms	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
covering	I-CONTENT
up	I-CONTENT
during	I-CONTENT
peak	I-CONTENT
biting	I-CONTENT
times	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
wearing	I-CONTENT

removing	I-CONTENT
any	I-CONTENT

water	I-CONTENT
which	I-CONTENT
provides	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
breeding	I-CONTENT
ground	I-CONTENT
for	I-CONTENT
mosquitoes	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	O
other	O
disease	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
aware	O
of	O
is	O
dengue	O
fever	O
.	O

It	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
transmitted	I-CONTENT
by	I-CONTENT
some	I-CONTENT
species	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
mosquito	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
since	I-CONTENT
there	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
no	I-CONTENT
prophylactic	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
it	I-CONTENT
's	I-CONTENT
more	I-CONTENT
important	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
prevention	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
sought	I-CONTENT
by	I-CONTENT
reducing	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
habitat	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
number	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
mosquitoes	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
limiting	I-CONTENT
exposure	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
bites	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	B-CONTENT
number	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
dengue	I-CONTENT
cases	I-CONTENT
has	I-CONTENT
varied	I-CONTENT
greatly	I-CONTENT
over	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
years	I-CONTENT
because	I-CONTENT
dengue	I-CONTENT
cases	I-CONTENT
tend	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
arise	I-CONTENT
from	I-CONTENT
outbreaks	I-CONTENT
.	O

In	O
most	O
years	O
,	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
cases	O
per	O
year	O
is	O
less	O
than	O
50	O
,	O

in	O
2005	O
,	O
2009	O
&	O
2010	O
,	O
cases	O
numbered	O
in	O
the	O
several	O

If	O

Corozal	O
,	O
Orange	O
Walk	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
other	O

so	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
disease	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
just	O
occur	O
in	O
smaller	O
remote	O
villages	O

Since	O
1998	O

again	O
it	O
's	O
up	O
to	O

now	O

coughing	B-CONTENT

(	O

The	O
amount	O

in	O
the	O
case	O

protection	O
to	O
her	O

For	O

Our	I-CONTENT
perspective	I-CONTENT
:	I-CONTENT
Like	I-CONTENT
any	I-CONTENT
other	I-CONTENT
medical	I-CONTENT
treatment	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT

must	I-CONTENT

an	I-CONTENT

risk/benefit	I-CONTENT
analysis	I-CONTENT

All	O
risks	O

benefits	O
must	O
be	O
considered	O
.	O

Any	O
rational	O
medical	O
treatment	O
must	O
do	O
more	O
good	O
than	O
harm	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
universally	O
accepted	O
.	O

The	O
problem	O
with	O

is	O
that	B-CONTENT
risks	I-CONTENT
have	I-CONTENT
been	I-CONTENT

,	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

In	O

the	O
risk	O
of	O

higher	O

the	O

The	O

be	O

the	B-SOURCE

Parents	B-SOURCE

about	I-SOURCE

regularly	B-CUE

all	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
non-vaccinated	I-CONTENT

are	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

be	I-CONTENT
banished	I-CONTENT
from	I-CONTENT

But	O
ironically	O
,	O
it	O

the	O

who	O
are	O
actually	O
the	O
“	O

”	O
of	O
live	O

that	O
they	O
were	O

So	O
who	O
,	O
really	O
,	O
should	O
we	O
avoid	O
?	O

Most	O
of	O
us	O
know	O
that	O
anyone	O

even	O
one	O
that	O

can	O

This	O

How	O
measles	O
can	O
change	O
a	O
life	O
In	O
the	O
early	O
1990s	O
we	O
lived	O
in	O
Berlin	O
,	O
Germany	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
young	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
plans	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
.	O

My	I-CONTENT
wife	I-CONTENT
Anke	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
working	I-CONTENT
as	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
nurse	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
I	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
just	I-CONTENT
started	I-CONTENT
my	I-CONTENT
professional	I-CONTENT
career	I-CONTENT
as	I-CONTENT
an	I-CONTENT
engineer	I-CONTENT
.	O

We	O
became	O
a	O
little	O
family	O
when	O
Julian	O
,	O
our	O
older	O
son	O
,	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
of	O
1992	O
.	O

We	I-CONTENT
built	I-CONTENT
our	I-CONTENT
“	I-CONTENT
nest	I-CONTENT
”	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
great	I-CONTENT
friends	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
neighbours	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
simply	I-CONTENT
enjoyed	I-CONTENT
life	I-CONTENT
as	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
young	I-CONTENT
family	I-CONTENT
.	O

As	O
most	O
parents	O
probably	O
are	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
grateful	O
and	O
thankful	O
.	O

Two	O
years	O
later	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
summer	O
of	O
1994	O
,	O
our	O
second	O
child	O
,	O
Maximilian	O
,	O
saw	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
day	O
and	O
made	O
our	O
family	O
happiness	O
complete	O
.	O

Back	O
then	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
slightest	O
idea	O
of	O
how	O
dramatically	O
our	O
lives	O
would	O
change	O
some	O
years	O
later	O
.	O

Max	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
blessing	O
and	O
a	O
challenge	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
energy	O
and	O
life	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
sometimes	O
hard	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
under	O
control	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
charming	O
,	O
even	O
as	O
a	O
baby	O
.	O

He	O
won	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
around	O
him	O
in	O
no	O
time	O
.	O

Max	O
in	O
2005	O
When	O
he	O
got	O
sick	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
of	O
1994/1995	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
bit	O
worried	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
young	O
age	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
six	O
months	O
old	O
when	O
measles	O
hit	O
him	O
badly	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
way	O
too	O
early	O
for	O
vaccination	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
too	O
early	O
for	O
infection	O
.	O

He	O
spent	O
several	O
days	O
with	O
a	O
high	O
fever	O
while	O
his	B-SOURCE
paediatrician	I-SOURCE
feared	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
he	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
develop	I-CONTENT
some	I-CONTENT
sort	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
complications	I-CONTENT
.	O

And	O
he	O
did	O
:	O
his	O
lungs	O
got	O
affected	O
,	O
he	O
developed	O
a	O
dry	O
cough	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
he	O
even	O
had	O
difficulties	O
breathing	O
.	O

We	I-CONTENT
were	I-CONTENT
concerned	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
but	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
no	I-CONTENT
clue	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
nobody	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
ever	I-CONTENT
mentioned	I-CONTENT
anything	I-CONTENT
about	I-CONTENT
potentially	I-CONTENT
fatal	I-CONTENT
measles	I-CONTENT
complications	I-CONTENT
.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
everything	O
was	O
over	O
.	O

Max	O
had	O
recovered	O
and	O
as	O
spring	O
came	O
around	O
,	O
the	O
vivid	O
,	O
high-energy	O
boy	O
was	O
back	O
.	O

What	B-CONTENT
we	I-CONTENT
did	I-CONTENT
not	I-CONTENT
know	I-CONTENT
back	I-CONTENT
then	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
he	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
only	I-CONTENT
stay	I-CONTENT
with	I-CONTENT
us	I-CONTENT
for	I-CONTENT
another	I-CONTENT
10	I-CONTENT
years	I-CONTENT
.	O

When	O
Max	O
was	O
in	O
third	O
grade	O
of	O
elementary	O
school	O
his	O
performance	O
in	O
math	O
suddenly	O
dropped	O
.	O

Initially	O
we	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
his	O
high	O
energy	O
level	O
and	O
his	O
difficulty	O
concentrating	O
sometimes	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
he	O
started	O
showing	O
some	O
strange	O
behaviours	O
–	O
only	O
for	O
short	O
moments	O
,	O
but	O
becoming	O
more	O
frequent	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
realise	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
signs	O
…	O
In	O
October	O
of	O
2004	O
the	O
first	O
seizure	O
occurred	O
.	O

Max	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
stop	I-CONTENT
doing	I-CONTENT
anything	I-CONTENT
–	I-CONTENT
from	I-CONTENT
one	I-CONTENT
second	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
other	I-CONTENT
–	I-CONTENT
he	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
sit	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
stare	I-CONTENT
.	O

Just	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
seconds	O
or	O
sometimes	O
a	O
minute	O
.	O

When	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
seizure	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
over	I-CONTENT
,	O
he	B-SOURCE
could	B-CUE
not	I-CUE
remember	I-CUE
anything	B-CONTENT
.	O

We	B-SOURCE
learned	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
this	I-CONTENT
kind	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
seizure	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
called	I-CONTENT
‘	I-CONTENT
absence	I-CONTENT
’	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	O
doctors	O
told	O
us	O
that	B-CONTENT
sometimes	I-CONTENT
children	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
develop	I-CONTENT
this	I-CONTENT
kind	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
epilepsy	I-CONTENT
when	I-CONTENT
they	I-CONTENT
were	I-CONTENT
just	I-CONTENT
about	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
enter	I-CONTENT
puberty	I-CONTENT
.	O

So	O
we	B-SOURCE
thought	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
maybe	I-CONTENT
it	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT
temporary	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
eventually	I-CONTENT
go	I-CONTENT
away	I-CONTENT
.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
bad	O
sign	O
:	O
Max	O
’s	O
EEG	O
that	O
was	O
taken	O
shortly	O
after	O
his	B-CONTENT
first	I-CONTENT
seizure	I-CONTENT
was	I-CONTENT
entirely	I-CONTENT
abnormal	I-CONTENT
.	O

There	I-CONTENT
were	I-CONTENT
curve	I-CONTENT
patterns	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
did	I-CONTENT
not	I-CONTENT
belong	I-CONTENT
there	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	O
doctors	O
tried	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
seizures	O
by	O
a	O
special	O
mix	O
of	O
anticonvulsants	O
.	O

And	O
actually	O
it	O
did	O
help	O
–	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
.	O

Between	O
December	O
of	O
2004	O
and	O
February	O
of	O
2005	O
our	O
beloved	O
boy	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
.	O

We	B-SOURCE
thought	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
finally	I-CONTENT
we	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
everything	I-CONTENT
under	I-CONTENT
control	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
seizures	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
eventually	I-CONTENT
go	I-CONTENT
away	I-CONTENT
.	O

We	O
did	O
n’t	O
worry	O
about	O
him	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
school	O
anymore	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
could	O
n’t	O
keep	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
lessons	O
.	O

We	B-SOURCE
ignored	B-CUE
the	B-CONTENT
fact	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
he	I-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
not	I-CONTENT
remember	I-CONTENT
things	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
just	I-CONTENT
happened	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
few	I-CONTENT
hours	I-CONTENT
before	I-CONTENT
.	O

We	O
ignored	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
his	O
behaviour	O
became	O
more	O
…	O
We	O
just	O
did	O
n’t	O
want	O
to	O
realise	O
what	O
was	O
happening	O
.	O

The	O
seizures	O
came	O
back	O
in	O
March	O
.	O

Heavy	O
,	O
frequent	O
and	O
different	O
.	O

The	O
doctors	O
sent	O
us	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
epilepsy	O
centres	O
in	O
Germany	O
at	O
Kehl-Kork	O
.	O

They	O
only	O
needed	O
a	O
few	O
examinations	O
to	O
confirm	O
the	O
worst	O
suspicions	O
:	O
Max	O
was	O
diagnosed	O
with	O

fatal	O
–	O
in	O
any	O
case	O
,	O
without	O
exception	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
hard	O
for	O
us	O
to	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
talking	O
about	O
our	O
bright	O
,	O

,	O
vivid	O
10-year-old	O

.	O

We	I-CONTENT
were	I-CONTENT
numb	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
desperate	I-CONTENT
,	O
did	B-CUE
not	I-CUE
understand	I-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
doctors	I-CONTENT
were	I-CONTENT
telling	I-CONTENT
us	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
we	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
lose	I-CONTENT
our	I-CONTENT

–	I-CONTENT
no	I-CONTENT

what	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
just	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
matter	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
when	I-CONTENT
.	O

We	O
fought	O
hard	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
.	O

We	I-CONTENT
spent	I-CONTENT
nights	I-CONTENT
on	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
internet	I-CONTENT
seeking	I-CONTENT
for	I-CONTENT
rescue	I-CONTENT
,	I-CONTENT
for	I-CONTENT
some	I-CONTENT
sort	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
treatment	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
would	I-CONTENT
stop	I-CONTENT
us	I-CONTENT
from	I-CONTENT
going	I-CONTENT
down	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
path	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT
inevitable	I-CONTENT
.	O

We	O
established	O
contacts	O
with	O
medical	O
scientists	O
in	O
India	O
,	O
Turkey	O
and	O
the	O
US	O

We	I-CONTENT

is	O

in	O

our	B-SOURCE

An	O

put	O

Within	O
only	O

he	O

he	O

His	B-CONTENT
last	I-CONTENT

20	I-CONTENT

are	I-CONTENT

197,000	I-CONTENT

This	O
appears	O
to	O

where	O
they	O
are	O

their	O
figure	O

1	O

The	B-SOURCE

the	I-CONTENT

So	O
if	O
half	O

the	O
roughly	O
200,000	O

occurs	O
in	O

the	O

the	O

100,000	O

SOME	O

So	O
the	O
1	O
in	O
1,000	O

Our	O

we	I-CONTENT
had	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
rush	I-CONTENT
her	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

her	I-CONTENT

that	O

But	O
sadly	O
,	O
I	O
fear	O
,	O
doctors	O
have	O
already	O
decided	O
that	O

for	O
them	O
to	O
risk	O

it	O
by	O
finding	O
out	O
the	O
truth	O
.	O

Tragically	O
,	O
many	O
doctors	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
painfully	O
ignorant	O
about	O
the	O
vaccines	O
they	O
advocate	O
.	O

They	O
do	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
told	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
unquestioningly	O
and	O
unthinkingly	O
,	O
and	O
check	O
their	O

Government	I-CONTENT

The	O

is	O
that	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

are	O
the	O
crudest	O

I	O
'm	O
always	O
startled	O
that	O
this	B-CONTENT
should	I-CONTENT
surprise	I-CONTENT
anyone	I-CONTENT

If	I-CONTENT
you	I-CONTENT
inject	I-CONTENT
potentially	I-CONTENT
toxic	I-CONTENT
substances	I-CONTENT
into	I-CONTENT
small	I-CONTENT

it	I-CONTENT
seems	B-CUE
pretty	B-CONTENT
obvious	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
me	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT
you	I-CONTENT
will	I-CONTENT
get	I-CONTENT
problems	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	O
brain	O
is	O
a	O
delicate	O

The	I-CONTENT
developing	I-CONTENT
brain	I-CONTENT
of	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
baby	I-CONTENT

is	I-CONTENT
particularly	I-CONTENT
delicate	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
very	I-CONTENT
easily	I-CONTENT
disrupted	I-CONTENT
.	O

The	O
most	O
significant	O
known	O
fact	O
about	O
vaccines	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
cause	O
brain	O
damage	O

And	O
they	O
can	O

This	O

theory	O

It	O
is	O
fact	O

For	O
example	O

doctors	O
have	O
noticed	O
that	O
there	O

a	O
relationship	O

protracted	O

inconsolable	O
high	O

This	B-CONTENT
seems	B-CUE
to	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT
consistent	I-CONTENT
with	I-CONTENT
a	I-CONTENT
link	I-CONTENT
between	I-CONTENT
vaccination	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
encephalopathy	I-CONTENT

This	O

could	O
be	O
deeply	O

Astonishingly	O
,	O
when	O
the	B-SOURCE
American	I-SOURCE
Academy	I-SOURCE

announced	B-CUE
that	B-CONTENT
one	I-CONTENT

No	B-CONTENT
one	I-CONTENT

to	I-CUE

just	B-CONTENT
why	I-CONTENT

many	I-CONTENT

Four	B-SOURCE

Some	B-SOURCE

that	B-CONTENT
the	I-CONTENT

now	I-CONTENT
supposed	I-CONTENT
to	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT

of	I-CONTENT

could	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT

If	I-CONTENT
ADHD	I-CONTENT
exists	I-CONTENT
(	I-CONTENT
and	I-CONTENT
there	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
much	I-CONTENT
doubt	I-CONTENT
about	I-CONTENT

then	I-CONTENT
it	I-CONTENT
certainly	I-CONTENT
could	I-CONTENT
be	I-CONTENT

And	O
if	O
it	O

the	O

Olivia	O

had	O
turned	O
into	O
a	O

called	O
measles	O

there	O
was	O
nothing	O

was	O
twenty-four	O

even	O
now	O

On	B-CONTENT

there	I-CONTENT
is	I-CONTENT
today	I-CONTENT
something	I-CONTENT
that	I-CONTENT

can	I-CONTENT
do	I-CONTENT

this	I-CONTENT

I	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O

that	O
for	O
Olivia	O
in	O

is	O
about	O

of	O
your	O

what	O
on	O

are	O
you	O
worrying	O
about	O

It	O
really	O
is	O
almost	O
a	O

to	O
allow	O
your	O

The	O
ideal	O

it	O

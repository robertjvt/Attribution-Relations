# Attribution-Relations
My master thesis on Attribution Relations (ARs) at the University of Groningen. 

## Overview
The general goal is to determine to what extent combining different datasets together can help 
with achieving better results for predicting ARs in textual data (genre news).

## To-do
- [ ] Go over and check all data for correctness
- [ ] Finalize (all-at-once) CRF features
- [ ] Determine pipeline CRF: k-NN or verb list
- [ ] Run experiments on all dataset combinations
- [ ] Develop Transformer-based models (RoBERTa or SpanBERT probably)
- [ ] Ensure reproducibility via Poetry or a requirements.txt
- [ ]
